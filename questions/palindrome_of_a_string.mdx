## Palindrome of a string
Given a string,you need to check wheather a string is **palindrome** or **not palindrome**.

> A string is said to be palindrome if given string and reverse of that string will same.In other words, A string, that reads same from backward and forward is known as palindrome. for example - level or madam.

Input 1:
- first line will contain the string
```
hashtable
```
Output:
- print **palindrome** if string is palindrome or print **not palindrome** if not palindrome.
```
not palindrome
```
Explanation: since **h is not equal to e** so string will break here and print not palindrome.
Input 2:
```
input - racecar

output - palindrome
```

#### Approach 1:
A naive approach is to take two pointers to traverse the string from both ends and compares the characters at the two pointers.

```
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
string s;
cout<<"Enter a string: ";
cin>>s;

int flag = 1;
int n = s.length();
for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    if(s[i] != s[n-i-1]) {
        flag = 0;
        break;
    }
}
if(flag) cout<<"palindrome."<<endl;
else cout<<"not  palindrome."<<endl;
return 0;
}
```
**Time Complexity :** $\mathcal{O}(n)$,where n is the length of string.

#### Approach 2:
- In above solution we are running loop till n which is not necessary because it is repeating the same character after n/2 so run the loop till n/2.

- here in the code we are using two pointer as **i and n-i** and only change is run loop till half of the string
```
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
string s;
cout<<"Enter a string: ";
cin>>s;

int flag = 1;
int n = s.length();
for(int i=0; i<n/2; i++) {
    if(s[i] != s[n-i-1]) {
        flag = 0;
        break;
    }
}
if(flag) cout<<"palindrome."<<endl;
else cout<<"not  palindrome."<<endl;
return 0;
}
```
**Time Complexity :** $\mathcal{O}(\frac{n}{2})$ where n is the length of string.
