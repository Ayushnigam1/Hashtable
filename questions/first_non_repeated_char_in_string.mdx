## First non repeated char in  the string
Given a string s consisting of characters,you need to print the **first non-repeated char** from that string.

Input 1:
- first line will contain the string

```
hashtable
```
Output:
- print the first non-repeated char.
```
s
```
Explanation: here **h and a** are two times in the string but **s** in the first char in the string whose occurance is one. 

Input 2:
```
input - algorithm

output - a
```
#### Approach 1:

The naive approach is to run a loop over the string and find the occurance of the character in the string, at any moment if the occurance is 1, return the character.
```
code
```
#### Approach 2:

Here's an optimised approach by make use of **hashmap**.

- Create an empty map to store the count of each character in the string.
- Loop through the string, and for each character, update the count in the map.
- Loop through the string again, and check the count of each character in the map. If the count is 1, return the character, as it's the first non-repeated character.
  
This approach has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where n is the length of the string.

```
code
```
