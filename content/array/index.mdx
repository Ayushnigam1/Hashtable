## Array

>An array is a linear data structure, containing items in contiguous memory

Since it's contiguous memory blocks, the array items can be indexed, the index 
of the first element is **base index** and subsequent items can be obtained by
add **offset** to the base index.

Value of the offset depends on the type of data we are storing in the array

Size of the array is fixed, Once a array is declared a fixed amount of memory
is allocated for it.

Memory address for a item in array is calculated as:
$$
memory\ address = base\ address + index * sizeof(item)
$$

### Operations in Array

#### Insertion
We can insert a value at a specific index, if the index exists, as the array 
provides random access.

Time complexity - $O(1)$

#### Access
We can access a value at a specific index, if the index exists.

#### Searching
We can search for a item in a array. One can access all the items in the array
till the required item is found.

Time complexity
- [Linear Search](https://hashtable.pages.dev/array/linear_search) - $O(n)$
- [Binary Search](https://hashtable.pages.dev/array/binary_search) - $O(log(n)$
